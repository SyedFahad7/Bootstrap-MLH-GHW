# Bootstrap Website Template

## What it does

The Bootstrap Website Template I made is all about showing off a modern design that works well on phones, tablets, and computers. It has a slick navigation bar, a cool image slider, and even fun emoji gifs you can click on.

## What's next for Bootstrap Website Template

Next, I want to add more cool features and maybe upgrade to Bootstrap 5. I'll keep improving it to make sure it's easy to use and looks awesome on any screen.
